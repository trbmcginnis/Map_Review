<strong> Review of the Urban Displacement Project Interactive Map </strong> <p>
 
  The <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/map/sf">
<strong> Urban Displacement Project </strong> </a>investigates the process of gentrification and displacement of lower income households from neighborhoods in San Francisco and surrounding areas. The University of California Berkeley as well as several community level and governmental organizations contribute to the project through providing data and creating resources to develop a better understanding of past gentrification trends (1990 through 2013) with the intention of better predicting future patterns. The project provides a detailed and data-driven analysis of the issue of low-income household displacement through dividing neighborhoods into categories based on income levels and gentrification risk. The project provides an interactive choropleth map that includes user-friendly legends and tools to help the user navigate through the data. The creators of the map have included a layer control that displays a wide range of different datasets, and a layer control that isolates the data by city or county. 
  The map page contains links to reports that explain the research methods and gives a more in-depth explanation of how to determine the risk of displacement. There is also another interactive choropleth map (through clicking on the tab titled <a href = "http://www.urbandisplacement.org/policy-tools-2"> <strong> Policy Tools</strong>) </a> detailing which districts have anti-displacement policies in effect through government initiatives. <p>
  The project successfully created an aesthetically pleasing visualization of the data and also succeeded in providing the user with clarification on each variable included in the study. The maps allow for users to click over each of the districts to display pop ups with information about that location, and users are able to zoom in and out and observe the boundaries of each district. The website includes key findings, case studies, a timeline of related events, and further resources on the subject. The numerous organizations that came together to create and investigate this database produced a comprehensive breakdown of gentrification patterns that are easily navigable for viewers.  <p>
  The project could benefit from overlaying the policy map onto the displacement map in order to demonstrate whether certain areas are actually benefiting from the policy intervention. The project could also benefit from developing a more understandable explanation so that audience members that are not experts in this field have an easier time understanding the analysis process. The excel file included on the displacement map web page contains explanations of each variable along with where this information is sourced from, but there are no links on the page that provide a data file with all of the numerical data used for the making of the map. This may inhibit user satisfaction, as users are not able to easily access the raw data on the same page as the map. <p>
